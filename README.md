# LegalEase — India

**Your Right to Know. Your Right to Act.**

LegalEase is not just another app — it's a movement. 

In Mumbai, thousands of people are harassed, misinformed, or simply unaware of their rights — whether it’s a tenant dealing with a greedy landlord, a student facing wrongful police action, or someone scared to file an FIR. LegalEase solves this.

### What We’re Building:
A powerful, offline-first, AI-powered mobile app to give every Mumbaikar free, instant, and anonymous access to:
- **Civic & Legal Rights** in clear, simple Hindi-English
- **FIR Filing Help** with video guides
- **Police Rules & Process** explained for real-life action
- **Map-Based Lawyer Discovery**
- **Post Your Incident** anonymously via video or voice
- **No Sign-Up Needed** — privacy is your right too

### Why This Matters:
Law is power — and power should belong to the people, not just lawyers.

We’re starting with Mumbai, but this is for *every Indian*. Collaborators, devs, and volunteers — jump in.
